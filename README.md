Recreation of the ls system command

This was mostly an exercise in populating and sorting a binary tree recursively, but there was a lot to be learned about the linux file system here as well.
The following flags are supported:
```
-R : recursively displays all files in all child directories
-t : sorts output by time of creation, rather than the default (lexicographical)
-a : displays hidden files and directories
-r : reverses output order
```
